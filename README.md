YAAF - Yet Another Agentic Framework
==========================

YAAF is a framework designed to facilitate the development of agentic applications. 
It provides a basic set of modular components that can be used to build complex systems.
It features a backend and a frontend, allowing for a complete development environment.

It's still a work in progress, but the goal is to create a framework that is easy to use and extend.
