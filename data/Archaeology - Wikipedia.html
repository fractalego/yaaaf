Study of human activity based on materials left behind

Atapuerca <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_site_of_Atapuerca>, an archaeological site in Spain

*Archaeology* or *archeology*^[a] <#cite_note-spelling-1> is the study
of human activity through the recovery and analysis <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis> of material culture <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_culture>. The archaeological record
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_record> consists of
artifacts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)>,
architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture>, biofacts
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofact_(archaeology)> or ecofacts, sites
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_site>, and cultural
landscapes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_landscape>.
Archaeology can be considered both a social science <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science> and a branch of the humanities
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities>.^[1] <#cite_note-
Renfrew_Bahn1991-2> ^[2] <#cite_note-3> ^[3] <#cite_note-4> It is
usually considered an independent academic discipline <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline>, but may also be classified
as part of anthropology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology> (in
North America – the four-field approach <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Four-field_approach>), history <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History>
or geography <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography>.^[4]
<#cite_note-5> The discipline involves surveying <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(archaeology)>, excavation <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_excavation>, and eventually
analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_excavation> of data
collected, to learn more about the past. In broad scope, archaeology
relies on cross-disciplinary research.

Archaeologists study human prehistory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Prehistory> and history, from the development of the first stone tools
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool> at Lomekwi <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomekwi> in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up
until recent decades.^[5] <#cite_note-6> Archaeology is distinct from
palaeontology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeontology>, which is
the study of fossil <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil> remains.
Archaeology is particularly important for learning about prehistoric
societies, for which, by definition, there are no written records.
Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past, from the Paleolithic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic> until the advent of literacy
in societies around the world.^[1] <#cite_note-Renfrew_Bahn1991-2>
Archaeology has various goals, which range from understanding culture
history <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_history> to
reconstructing past lifeways <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeway> to
documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.^[6]
<#cite_note-7> Derived from Greek, the term /archaeology/ means "the
study of ancient history".^[7] <#cite_note-8>

Archaeology developed out of antiquarianism <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Antiquarianism> in Europe during the 19th century, and has since
become a discipline practiced around the world. Archaeology has been
used by nation-states to create particular visions of the past.^[8]
<#cite_note-Encyclopédie_d'histoire_numérique_de_l'Europe-9> ^[9]
<#cite_note-10> Since its early development, various specific sub-
disciplines of archaeology have developed, including maritime
archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_archaeology>,
feminist archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Feminist_archaeology>, and archaeoastronomy <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Archaeoastronomy>, and numerous different scientific techniques
have been developed to aid archaeological investigation. Nonetheless,
today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with
pseudoarchaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoarchaeology>, the
looting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_looting> of
artifacts,^[10] <#cite_note-11> ^[11] <#cite_note-12> a lack of public
interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains.

In Ancient Mesopotamia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia>, a

king Nabonidus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabonidus>, c. 550 BC, who
is thus known as the first archaeologist.^[12] <#cite_note-RS-13> ^[13]
<#cite_note-RLK-14> ^[14] <#cite_note-15> Not only did he lead the first
excavations which were to find the foundation deposits of the temples of
Šamaš <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamash> the sun god, the warrior
goddess Anunitu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunitum> (both located
in Sippar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippar>), and the sanctuary
that Naram-Sin built to the moon god, located in Harran <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harran>, but he also had them restored to their
former glory.^[12] <#cite_note-RS-13> He was also the first to date an
archaeological artifact in his attempt to date Naram-Sin's temple during
his search for it.^[15] <#cite_note-hirst-16> Even though his estimate
was inaccurate by about 1,500 years, it was still a very good one
considering the lack of accurate dating technology at the time.^[12]

The science of archaeology (from Greek <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ancient_Greek> ἀρχαιολογία /archaiologia/, from ἀρχαῖος/arkhaios/
'ancient' and -λογία, /-logia/ 'study')^[16] <#cite_note-17> grew out of
the older multi-disciplinary study known as antiquarianism <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquarian>. Antiquarians studied history with
particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as
historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that
existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of
the 18th century antiquary, Richard Colt Hoare <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Colt_Hoare>: "We speak from facts, not
theory". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a
science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science> took place during the
Enlightenment period <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Age_of_Enlightenment> in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.^[17]
<#cite_note-18>

In Imperial China <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_China> during
the Song dynasty <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty> (960–
1279), figures such as Ouyang Xiu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ouyang_Xiu>^[18] <#cite_note-19> and Zhao Mingcheng <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Mingcheng> established the tradition of
Chinese epigraphy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy> by
investigating, preserving, and analyzing ancient Chinese bronze
inscriptions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_bronze_inscriptions>
from the Shang <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty> and Zhou
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty> periods.^[19]
<#cite_note-20> ^[20] <#cite_note-Trigger-2006-21> ^(p74) ^[21]
<#cite_note-Clunas-2004-22> ^(p95) In his book <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Pool_Essays> published in 1088, Shen Kuo
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo> criticized contemporary Chinese
scholars for attributing ancient bronze vessels as creations of famous
sages rather than artisan commoners, and for attempting to revive them
for ritual use without discerning their original functionality and
purpose of manufacture.^[22] <#cite_note-23> Such antiquarian pursuits
waned after the Song period, were revived in the 17th century during the
Qing dynasty <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty>, but were
always considered a branch of Chinese historiography <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_historiography> rather than a separate
discipline of archaeology.^[20] <#cite_note-Trigger-2006-21> ^(pp74–76)

In Renaissance Europe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Renaissance_Europe>, philosophical interest in the remains of Greco
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece>-Roman <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome> civilization and the rediscovery of
classical culture began in the late Middle Ages <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages>, with humanism <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism>.

Cyriacus of Ancona <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyriacus_of_Ancona>
was a restlessly itinerant Italian humanist <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Renaissance_humanism> and antiquarian <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Antiquarian> who came from a prominent family of merchants in
Ancona <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ancona>, a maritime
republic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_republics> on the
Adriatic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic>. He was called by his
contemporaries /pater antiquitatis/ ('father of antiquity') and today
"father of classical archaeology": /"Cyriac of Ancona was the most
enterprising and prolific recorder of Greek and Roman antiquities,
particularly inscriptions, in the fifteenth century, and the general
accuracy of his records entitles him to be called the founding father of
modern classical archeology."/^[23] <#cite_note-24> He travelled
throughout Greece and all around the Eastern Mediterranean, to record
his findings on ancient buildings, statues and inscriptions, including
archaeological remains still unknown to his time: the Parthenon
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon>, Delphi <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi>, the Egyptian pyramids <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids>, the hieroglyphics <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyphics>.^[24] <#cite_note-25> He noted down
his archaeological discoveries in his diary, /Commentaria/ (in six
volumes).

Flavio Biondo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavio_Biondo>, an Italian
Renaissance humanist historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins
and topography of ancient Rome <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Topography_of_ancient_Rome> in the early 15th century, for which he has
been called an early founder of archaeology.^[25] <#cite_note-26>

Antiquarians of the 16th century, including John Leland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leland_(antiquary)> and William Camden
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Camden>, conducted surveys of the
English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments
that they encountered.^[26] <#cite_note-27> ^[27] <#cite_note-28>

The /Oxford English Dictionary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Oxford_English_Dictionary>/ first cites "archaeologist" from 1824; this
soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian
activity. "Archaeology", from 1607 onward, initially meant what we would
call "ancient history" generally, with the narrower modern sense first
seen in 1837. However, it was Jacob Spon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jacob_Spon> who, in 1685, offered one of the earliest definitions
of /"archaeologia"/ to describe the study of antiquities in which he was
engaged, in the preface of a collection of transcriptions of Roman
inscriptions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy> which he had
gleaned over the years of his travels, entitled /Miscellanea eruditae
antiquitatis./

Twelfth-century Indian scholar Kalhana <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kalhana>'s writings involved recording of local traditions, examining
manuscripts, inscriptions, coins and architectures, which is described
as one of the earliest traces of archaeology. One of his notable work is
called /Rajatarangini/ which was completed c. 1150 and is described as
one of the first history books of India.^[28] <#cite_note-29> ^[29]

One of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was
Stonehenge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge> and other
megalithic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith> monuments in
England. John Aubrey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aubrey> (1626–
1697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous megalithic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith> and other field monuments
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_monument> in southern England. He
was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted
to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval
architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.^[31] <#cite_note-32>

Excavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer Roque
Joaquín de Alcubierre <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Roque_Joaqu%C3%ADn_de_Alcubierre> in the ancient towns of Pompeii
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii> and Herculaneum <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum>, both of which had been covered by
ash during the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_AD_79>. These
excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in
1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even
human shapes, as well the unearthing of frescos <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco>, had a big impact throughout Europe.

However, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations
tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as
stratification <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Stratification_(archaeology)> and context <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Archaeological_context> were overlooked.^[32] <#cite_note-33>

In the mid-18th century, the German Johann Joachim Winckelmann <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Joachim_Winckelmann> lived in Rome and
devoted himself to the study of Roman antiquities, gradually acquiring
an unrivalled knowledge of ancient art.^[33] <#cite_note-34> Then, he
visited the archaeological excavations being conducted at Pompeii
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii> and Herculaneum <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum>.^[34] <#cite_note-35> He was one of
the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories
of style on a large, systematic basis to the history of art <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_art>^[35] <#cite_note-36> He was one of
the first to separate Greek art into periods and time
classifications.^[36] <#cite_note-37> Winckelmann has been called both
"The prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_archaeology>"^[37] <#cite_note-b584-38> and
the father of the discipline of art history <https://en.wikipedia.org/

Development of archaeological method

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Both_Lozenges.jpg>Artifacts
discovered at the 1808 Bush Barrow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bush_Barrow> excavation by Sir Richard Colt Hoare <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Colt_Hoare> and William Cunnington
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cunnington>.

The father of archaeological excavation was William Cunnington <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cunnington> (1754–1810). He undertook
excavations in Wiltshire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire> from
around 1798,^[39] <#cite_note-40> funded by Sir Richard Colt Hoare.
Cunnington made meticulous recordings of Neolithic <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic> and Bronze Age <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age> barrows <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Tumulus>, and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are
still used by archaeologists today.^[40] <#cite_note-41> Future U.S.
President <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States>
Thomas Jefferson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson> also
did his own excavations in 1784 using the trench <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench> method, on several Native American
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States>
burial mounds in Virginia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia>. His
excavations were prompted by the "Moundbuilders" question <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound_Builders>; however, his careful methods led
him to admit he saw no reason why ancestors of the Native Americans of
his time could not have raised those mounds.^[41] <#cite_note-42>

One of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the
development of stratigraphy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Stratigraphy>. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive
periods was borrowed from the new geological <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Geology> and palaeontological <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Palaeontology> work of scholars like William Smith <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_(geologist)>, James Hutton <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hutton> and Charles Lyell <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lyell>. The systematic application of
stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of
prehistorical <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory> and Bronze Age
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age> sites. In the third and
fourth decades of the 19th century, archaeologists like Jacques Boucher
de Perthes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Boucher_de_Perthes>
and Christian Jürgensen Thomsen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Christian_J%C3%BCrgensen_Thomsen> began to put the artifacts they had
found in chronological order.

A major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science
was army officer and ethnologist <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ethnology> Augustus Pitt Rivers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Augustus_Pitt_Rivers>,^[42] <#cite_note-43> who began excavations on his
land in England in the 1880s. Highly methodical by the standards of the
time, he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He
arranged his artifacts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Pitt_Rivers_Museum> by type or "Typology (archaeology) <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typology_(archaeology)>", and within types
chronologically. This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the
evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for
the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological
innovation was his insistence that /all/ artifacts, not just beautiful
or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.^[43] <#cite_note-44>

William Flinders Petrie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
William_Flinders_Petrie> is another man who may legitimately be called
the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of
artifacts, both in Egypt and later in Palestine <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)>, laid down many of the ideas
behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that "I believe the
true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest
details." Petrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery
and ceramic findings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Seriation_(archaeology)>, which revolutionized the chronological basis
of Egyptology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptology>. Petrie was the
first to scientifically investigate the Great Pyramid <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza> in Egypt during the
1880s.^[44] <#cite_note-45> He was also responsible for mentoring and
training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including Howard Carter
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Carter> who went on to achieve
fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh
Tutankhamun <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun>.

The first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public
was that of Hissarlik <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hissarlik>, on the
site of ancient Troy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy>, carried out
by Heinrich Schliemann <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Frank_Calvert> and Wilhelm Dörpfeld <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wilhelm_D%C3%B6rpfeld> in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine
different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory
to the Hellenistic period <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Hellenistic_period>.^[45] <#cite_note-46> Meanwhile, the work of Sir
Arthur Evans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Evans> at Knossos
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos> in Crete <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete> revealed the ancient existence of an
equally advanced Minoan civilization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Minoan_civilization>.^[46] <#cite_note-47>

The next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir Mortimer
Wheeler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_Wheeler>, whose highly
disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s
and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the grid
system of excavation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler-
Kenyon_method>,^[47] <#cite_note-48> which was further improved by his
student Kathleen Kenyon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kenyon>.

Archaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the
20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject
in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly
all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were
graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in
this period, when maritime archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Maritime_archaeology> and urban archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Urban_archaeology> became more prevalent and rescue archaeology
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_archaeology> was developed as a
result of increasing commercial development.^[48] <#cite_note-

Purpose

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=6>]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Australopithecus_africanus_-
_Cast_of_taung_child.jpg>Cast of the skull of the Taung child <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taung_child>, uncovered in South Africa <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa>. The Child was an infant of the /
Australopithecus africanus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Australopithecus_africanus>/ species, an early form of hominin <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominin>

The purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the
development of the human <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human> race.
Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within prehistoric
cultures, who did not make use of writing <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Literacy>, thereby no written records exist for study purposes.
Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric
societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of
past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago
when the first stone tools are found – The Oldowan Industry <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldowan>. Many important developments in human
history occurred during prehistory, such as the evolution of humanity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution> during the Paleolithic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic> period, when the hominins
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominin> developed from the
australopithecines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecines> in
Africa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa> and eventually into
modern /Homo sapiens <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens>/.
Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological
advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of stone
tools <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool>, the discovery of
metallurgy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy>, the beginnings of
religion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion> and the creation of
agriculture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture>. Without
archaeology, little or nothing would be known about the use of material
culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.^[49] <#cite_note-ncl-50>

However, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be
studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well,
through the sub-discipline of historical archaeology <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_archaeology>. For many literate
cultures, such as Ancient Greece <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ancient_Greece> and Mesopotamia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mesopotamia>, their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to
some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the elite
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite> classes, such as the clergy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy>, or the bureaucracy <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy> of court or temple. The literacy of
aristocrats <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy> has sometimes
been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of
elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the
populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of
the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library> and be preserved there for
posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases,
assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range
of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population.
Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material
record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is
subject to its own biases, such as sampling bias <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias> and differential preservation.^[50]
<#cite_note-archaeological-51>

Often, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and
behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of
cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of
which there is little or no written record or existing records are
misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not
exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively
small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, /
Homo sapiens/ has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species
of /Homo/ for millions of years (see Human evolution <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution>). These civilizations are, not
coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of
historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has
arisen only recently. Within a literate civilization many events and
important human practices may not be officially recorded. Any knowledge
of the early years of human civilization – the development of
agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first
cities – must come from archaeology.

In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains
sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the
people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or strong
aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of
such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than
with the reconstruction of past societies.

This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders
of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When unrealistic
subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are
invariably levelled at their proponents /(see Pseudoarchaeology
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoarchaeology>)/. However, these
endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern
archaeology.


Theory

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=7>]
Main article: Archaeological theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_theory>

There is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered
to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th
century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practised was
that of cultural-historical archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cultural-history_archaeology>, which held the goal of explaining why
cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that
they did, therefore emphasizing historical particularism <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_particularism>.^[51] <#cite_note-
autogenerated1-52> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who
studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones
(such as those of Native Americans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas>, Siberians <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia>, Mesoamericans <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Mesoamerica> etc.) followed the direct historical approach
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_historical_approach>, compared the
continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural
groups.^[51] <#cite_note-autogenerated1-52> In the 1960s, an
archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like
Lewis Binford <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Binford> and Kent
Flannery <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Flannery> arose that
rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.^[52]
<#cite_note-Binford1962-53> ^[53] <#cite_note-Flannery1967-54> They
proposed a "New Archaeology", which would be more "scientific" and
"anthropological", with hypothesis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Hypothesis> testing and the scientific method <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Scientific_method> very important parts of what became known as
processual archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Processual_archaeology>.^[51] <#cite_note-autogenerated1-52>

In the 1980s, a new postmodern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Shanks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

<#cite_note-Hodder1992-67> which has become known as post-processual
archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-processual_archaeology>.
It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and
impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical
theoretical reflexivity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Reflexivity_(social_theory)>.^[/citation needed <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] However, this
approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific
rigour, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is
still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as historical
processualism <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Historical_processualism&action=edit&redlink=1>, has emerged
seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual
archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.^[67] <#cite_note-

including systems theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Methods

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?

File:Indusketa_arkeologikoa.webm><https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Indusketa_arkeologikoa.webm>Video showing the different works in an
archaeological recovery and analysis

An archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct
phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any
practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the
archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a
site is surveyed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_survey>
to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area.
Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological
features buried under the ground. And, third, the information collected
during the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve
the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then
considered good practice for the information to be published so that it
is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is
sometimes neglected.^[30] <#cite_note-renfrew-31>


Remote sensing

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=9>]

Before actually starting to dig in a location, remote sensing <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing_(archaeology)> can be used to look
where sites are located within a large area or provide more information
about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing
instruments—passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural
energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive
instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or
reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active
instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. Satellite imagery
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery> is an example of
passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:

  * *Lidar*: Lidar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar> (light
    detection and ranging) uses a laser (light amplification by
    stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a
    receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or
    reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording
    the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using
    the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can
    determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other
    constituents of the atmosphere.
  * *Laser altimeter*: A laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to
    measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By
    independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the
    mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can
    be determined.^[69] <#cite_note-70>
  * *Drones*: Archaeologists around the world use drones <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle> to speed up survey
    work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. In Peru,
    small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of
    Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps – and in days and
    weeks instead of months and years.^[70] <#cite_note-peru-71> Drones
    costing as little as £650 have proven useful. In 2013, drones have
    flown over at least six Peruvian archaeological sites, including the
    colonial Andean town Machu Llacta 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea
    level. The drones continue to have altitude problems in the Andes,
    leading to plans to make a drone blimp <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/Blimp>, employing open source software.^[70] <#cite_note-
    peru-71> Jeffrey Quilter, an archaeologist with Harvard University
    said, "You can go up three metres and photograph a room, 300 metres
    and photograph a site, or you can go up 3,000 metres and photograph
    the entire valley."^[70] <#cite_note-peru-71> In September 2014
    drones weighing about 5 kg (11 lb) were used for 3D mapping of the
    above-ground ruins of the Greek city of Aphrodisias <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodisias>. The data are being analysed by
    the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Vienna.^[71] <#cite_note-72> 


Field survey

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=10>]
Main article: Archaeological survey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_survey>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Distribution_of_surveyed_areas_(blue)_within_the_southern_Mesopotamian_floodplains_(yellow).webp>Satellite image of Mesopotamia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia> (with the Persian Gulf in the lower right corner) indicating the areas that have been subjected to regional surveys (in blue) over the past decades

The archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins)
with a field survey. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically
locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt
to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and
middens <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midden>, within a site. Each of
these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practised in the early days of archaeology.
Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with
discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace,
and excavating only the plainly visible features <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(archaeology)> there. Gordon Willey
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Willey> pioneered the technique of
regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the Viru Valley <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viru_Valley> of coastal Peru <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru>,^[72] <#cite_note-Willey1953-73> ^[73]
<#cite_note-Willey1968-74> and survey of all levels became prominent
with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.^[74]
<#cite_note-Billmand_Feinman1999-75>

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to,
or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and
expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to
search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site
can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ sampling <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)> methods.)^[75] <#cite_note-
Redman1974-76> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology,
survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant
peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the
only way to gather some forms of information, such as settlement
patterns <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement> and settlement
structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into maps <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map>, which may show surface features and/or
artifact distribution.

The simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an
area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized
transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface.
Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely
buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may
also include mini-excavation techniques such as augers <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auger_(drill)>, corers, and shovel test <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovel_test> pits. If no materials are found, the
area surveyed is deemed sterile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sterile_deposit>.

File:Archeoscan_excavation_site.jpg>Inverted kite aerial photo of an
excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.

Aerial survey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_survey> is conducted
using cameras <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera> attached to
airplanes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane>, balloons <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)>, UAVs <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAVs>, or even Kites <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Kite>.^[76] <#cite_note-77> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick
mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to
document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also
detect many things not visible from the surface. Plants <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant> growing above a buried human-made
structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those
above other types of features (such as middens <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midden>) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of
ripening grain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal>, which changes
colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great
precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help
show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey
also employs ultraviolet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet>,
infrared <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared>, ground-penetrating
radar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-penetrating_radar>
wavelengths, Lidar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar> and
thermography <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography>.^[77]
<#cite_note-78>

Geophysical survey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Geophysical_survey_(archaeology)> can be the most effective way to see
beneath the ground. Magnetometers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Magnetometer> detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field> caused by iron
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron> artifacts, kilns <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln>, some types of stone structures <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_structures>, and even ditches and middens.
Devices that measure the electrical resistivity <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity> of the soil are also
widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity
contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped.
Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick)
have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as
organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.

Although some archaeologists consider the use of metal detectors
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector> to be tantamount to
treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological
surveying.^[78] <#cite_note-79> Examples of formal archaeological use of
metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on English
Civil War <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War>
battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-
century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal
detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made
detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts
from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have
been solicited for involvement in the Portable Antiquities Scheme
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Antiquities_Scheme>.

Regional survey in underwater archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Underwater_archaeology> uses geophysical or remote sensing devices
such as marine magnetometer, side-scan sonar <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Side-scan_sonar>, or sub-bottom sonar.^[79] <#cite_note-80>

Island <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Island>.

Archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the
domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data
recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of
information usually not accessible to survey, such as stratigraphy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy>, three-dimensional
structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of
objects and features, known as their provenance <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance> or provenience, be recorded. This
always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes
vertical position as well (also see Primary Laws of Archaeology
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Harris_matrix#Harris'_laws_of_archaeological_stratigraphy>). Likewise,
their association <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_association>, or relationship <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Relationship_(archaeology)> with nearby objects and features
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(archaeology)>, needs to be
recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce
which artifacts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)>
and features were likely used together and which may be from different
phases <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_phase> of activity.
For example, excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy; if a site
was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more
recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in
relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries ethical
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics> concerns. As a result, very few
sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site
excavated depends greatly on the country and "method statement" issued.
Sampling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)> is even
more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical
equipment, such as backhoes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhoe>
(JCBs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._Bamford>), is used in
excavation, especially to remove the topsoil <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Topsoil> (overburden <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overburden>),
though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following
this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with
trowels <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trowel> or hoes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoe_(tool)> to ensure that all features are apparent.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ghamari_cave_(2).jpg>Archaeological
excavations in the Middle Paleolithic cave site of the Ghamari
Cave,Zagros 2025

The next task is to form a site plan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_plan> and then use it to help decide the method of
excavation. Features dug into the natural subsoil <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_natural> are normally excavated in
portions to produce a visible archaeological section <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_section> for recording. A feature,
for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the cut <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(archaeology)> and the fill <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill_(archaeology)>. The cut describes the edge of
the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the
feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and
will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill
are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and
sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white
and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_context_recording> sheets are filled in
describing the context <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_context> of each. All this information serves as a
permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in
describing and interpreting the site.


Analysis

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=12>]
Main article: Post-excavation analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Post-excavation_analysis>

seven known fossil teeth of /Homo luzonensis <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Homo_luzonensis>/ found in Callao Cave <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Callao_Cave>, the Philippines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Philippines>.

Once artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from
surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is
known as post-excavation analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-
excavation_analysis>, and is usually the most time-consuming part of an
archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation
reports for major sites to take years to be published.

At a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued
and compared to published collections. This comparison process often
involves classifying them typologically <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Typology_(archaeology)> and identifying other sites with similar
artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of
analytical techniques are available through archaeological science
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_science>, meaning that
artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants,
and pollen collected from a site can all be analysing using the methods
of zooarchaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooarchaeology>,
paleoethnobotany <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoethnobotany>,
palynology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palynology> and stable
isotopes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotopes>^[80]
<#cite_note-81> while any texts can usually be deciphered <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciphering>.

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise
be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of
a site.

Historical archaeology is the study of cultures with some form of
writing and deals with objects and issues from the past.

In medieval Europe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages>,
archaeologists have explored the illicit burial of unbaptized children
in medieval texts and cemeteries.^[82] <#cite_note-83> In downtown New
York City <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City>, archaeologists
have exhumed the 18th century remains of the African Burial Ground
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Burial_Ground_National_Monument>.
When remnants of the WWII <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWII> Siegfried
Line <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Line> were being
destroyed, emergency archaeological digs took place whenever any part of
the line was removed, to further scientific knowledge and reveal details
of the line's construction.

Ethnoarchaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoarchaeology> is the
ethnographic study of living people, designed to aid in our
interpretation of the archaeological record.^[83] <#cite_note-

<#cite_note-kuznar2001-93> Early ethnoarchaeological research focused on
hunter-gatherer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer> or

of the logical positivism of processualism with its goals of improving
the scientific rigor of archaeological epistemologies <https://

Archaeometry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeometry> aims to
systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of
analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a
field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the
chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.^[98]
<#cite_note-Glasscock_et_al1994-99> Archaeometry also investigates
different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as
space syntax techniques and geodesy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Archaeology can be a subsidiary activity within Cultural resources
management <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_resources_management>
(CRM), also called Cultural heritage management <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage_management> (CHM) in the United
Kingdom.^[103] <#cite_note-The_University_of_Exeter_–_SoGAER_–
_Department_of_Archaeology-104> CRM archaeologists frequently examine
archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM
accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United
States and much of that in western Europe <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Western_Europe> as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a
growing concern since the passage of the National Historic Preservation
Act <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Preservation_Act>
(NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe
that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and
prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of
cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates
that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits
consider the effects of the project on each archaeological site
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_site>.

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to
government-funded projects. Since 1990, PPG 16 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_16>^[104] <#cite_note-
Planning_Policy_Guidance_16:_Archaeology_and_planning_–
_Planning,_building_and_the_environment_–
_Communities_and_Local_Government-105> has required planners to consider
archaeology as a material consideration <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Material_consideration> in determining applications for new development.
As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation
work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically
sensitive areas, at the developer's expense <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Polluter_pays_principle>. Some of the largest archaeological
projects ever undertaken in the UK are due to major infrastructure
projects like A14 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A14_road_(England)>
road improvement scheme or the building of HS2 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS2>.^[105] <#cite_note-106> ^[106] <#cite_note-107>


In England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment
rests with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Culture,_Media_and_Sport>^[107]
<#cite_note-Department_for_Culture_Media_and_Sport_–

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland>, Wales <https://

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland>, the same responsibilities lie
with Historic Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Historic_Scotland>,^[109] <#cite_note-110> Cadw <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadw>^[110] <#cite_note-Cadw-111> and the Northern
Ireland Environment Agency <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Northern_Ireland_Environment_Agency>^[111] <#cite_note-
Built_Environment-112> respectively.

In France, the Institut national du patrimoine <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_national_du_patrimoine> (The National
Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in
archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The
curator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator> is the link between
scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and
the public.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and
maintenance of cultural <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural> sites
on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable
materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human
activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a
cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant
archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed
construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for
their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the
presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be
prohibited entirely.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is
conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting
proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is
not unheard of for the agency responsible for the construction to choose
the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face
considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in
a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly
endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site
reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to
the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Historic_Preservation_Office> (SHPO). From
the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report
submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year
academic project. The result is that for a Cultural Resource Management
archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic
quality documents at a corporate world pace.

The annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of
post-doc <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral>, temporary, and
non-tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/
MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management,
once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with "strong
backs and weak minds",^[112] <#cite_note-Flannery1982-113> has attracted
these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by
advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly
articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.


Protection

fact-finding mission in Libya

The protection of archaeological finds for the public from catastrophes,
wars and armed conflicts is increasingly being implemented
internationally. This happens on the one hand through international
agreements and on the other hand through organizations that monitor or
enforce protection. United Nations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
United_Nations>, UNESCO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO> and Blue
Shield International <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Blue_Shield_International> deal with the protection of cultural heritage
and thus also archaeological sites. This also applies to the integration
of United Nations peacekeeping <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
United_Nations_peacekeeping>. Blue Shield International has undertaken
various fact-finding missions in recent years to protect archaeological
sites during the wars in Libya, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. The importance
of archaeological finds for identity, tourism and sustainable economic
growth is repeatedly emphasized internationally.^[113] <#cite_note-114>

The president of Blue Shield International, Karl von Habsburg <https://

property protection mission in Lebanon in April 2019 with the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon: "Cultural assets are part of the
identity of the people who live in a certain place. If you destroy their
culture, you also destroy their identity. Many people are uprooted,
often have no prospects anymore and subsequently flee from their

Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular
artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned
cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general
tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology
and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something
only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is
depicted as a "romantic adventurist occupation",^[120] <#cite_note-
McGeough_2006_174–185-121> and as a hobby more than a job in the
scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of "who
archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to
the past are constituted",^[120] <#cite_note-McGeough_2006_174–185-121>
and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a
distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually
priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly
formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in
dramatic locales such as Copán <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cop%C3%A1n> and the Valley of the Kings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Valley_of_the_Kings>, but the bulk of activities and finds of modern
archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories
tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern
surveys, excavations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Excavation_(archaeology)>, and data processing. Some archaeologists
refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as "pseudoarchaeology".^[121]
<#cite_note-Romancing_the_Past-Archaeology-122> Archaeologists are also
very much reliant on public support; the question of for whom they are
working is often discussed.^[122] <#cite_note-Denning2004-123>


Current issues and controversy

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=22>]


Public archaeology

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=23>]

Motivated by a desire to halt looting, curb pseudoarchaeology, and to
help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering
public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage,
archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.^[123]
<#cite_note-Anthropological_Studies_Center_(ASC)-124> They seek to stop
looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected
sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the
threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press
releases, the encouragement of school field trips to sites under
excavation by professional archaeologists, and making reports and
publications accessible outside of academia.^[124] <#cite_note-125>
^[125] <#cite_note-126> Public appreciation of the significance of
archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection
from encroaching development or other threats.

One audience for archaeologists' work is the public. Archaeologists
increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-
archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate
and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is
aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as
community excavation projects, and better public presentations of
archaeological sites and knowledge.^[/citation needed <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] The U.S. Deptartment
of Agriculture, Forest Service <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
US_Forest_Service> (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic
preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work
with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests
throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of
professional archaeology under expert supervision.^[126] <#cite_note-
rapidcityjournal-127>

Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an
understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The /Mardi
Gras/ Shipwreck Project^[127] <#cite_note-128> integrated a one-hour HD
documentary,^[128] <#cite_note-Mystery_Mardi_Gras_Shipwreck-129> short
videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as
part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for
educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater
video <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_videography> of the /
Queen Anne's Revenge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

In the UK, popular archaeology programs such as /Time Team <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Team>/ and /Meet the Ancestors <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Ancestors>/ have resulted in a huge
upsurge in public interest.^[/citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] Where possible, archaeologists now
make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger
projects than they once did,^[132] <#cite_note-internet-133> and many
local archaeological organizations operate within the Community
archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_archaeology>
framework^[133] <#cite_note-134> to expand public involvement in
smaller-scale, more local projects. Archaeological excavation, however,
is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and
accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary health and
safety <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_safety> and indemnity
insurance issues involved in working on a modern building site <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction> with tight deadlines. Certain
charities and local government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Local_government> bodies sometimes offer places on research projects
either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.^[/
citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] There is also a flourishing industry
selling places on commercial training excavations <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_excavations> and archaeological holiday
tours.^[/citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local
historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why
Community archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Community_archaeology> projects are starting to become more common.
Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of
archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the
funding, nor the time to do.

Archaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-
profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999.
ALI founded a website, The Archaeology Channel <http://
archaeologychannel.org/> to support the organization's mission "to
nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by
using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible."^[134]
<#cite_note-
The_Archaeology_Channel_and_About_Us:_Archaeological_Legacy_Institute-135>

There is a considerable international body of research focused on
archaeology and public value and tangible benefits of archaeology
include^[135] <#cite_note-136> helping to counteract racism, documenting
accomplishments of ignored communities, providing time-depth as a
response to short-termism of the modern age, and contributing to human
ecology, independent evidence base, historic context development and
tourism.^[136] <#cite_note-137> The delivery of public benefits through
archaeology can be summarised as follows: through making a contribution
to a shared history,^[137] <#cite_note-138> artistic and cultural
treasures, local values, place-making and social cohesion, educational
benefits, contribution to science and innovation, health and wellbeing,
and added economic value to developers.^[138] <#cite_note-139> ^[132]

Pseudoarchaeology

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=24>]
Main article: Pseudoarchaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Pseudoarchaeology>

Pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely
claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and
scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional
archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity.
Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of
processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in
post-processualism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-
processual_archaeology>.^[/citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

An example of this type is the writing of Erich von Däniken <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_D%C3%A4niken>. His 1968 book, /Chariots
of the Gods? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods%3F>/,
together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of
ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more
technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory,
known as palaeocontact theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Palaeocontact_theory>, or Ancient astronaut theory <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronaut_theory>, is not exclusively
Däniken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are
usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the
basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a
preconceived theory in mind.^[/citation needed <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]


Looting

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=25>]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Looting_rontoy2007.jpg>A looter's
pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at Rontoy, Huaura
Valley, Peru <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru> in June 2007. Several
small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as
their footprints.

Looting of archaeological sites <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_looting> is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the
tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh>
were looted during antiquity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Classical_antiquity>.^[139] <#cite_note-civilizations-140> Archaeology
stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of
artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The
commercial and academic demand for artifacts contributes directly to the
illicit antiquities <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicit_antiquities>
trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused
great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments
lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and
destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information
about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially
lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately
denying them the opportunity to know their past.^[140] <#cite_note-
autogenerated2-141>

In 1937, W. F. Hodge the director of the Southwest Museum <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Museum> released a statement that the
museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted
contexts.^[141] <#cite_note-Hodge1937-142> The first conviction of the
transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archaeological_Resources_Protection_Act> was in 1992 in the State of
Indiana.^[142] <#cite_note-Munson_et_al1995-143>

Archaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by
looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists
who are viewed as looters by the locals.^[143] <#cite_note-144>

Some historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by metal
detector <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector> hobbyists who
search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are
underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase
education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals
in the metal detecting community.^[144] <#cite_note-145>

While most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when
amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor,
collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.


Descendant peoples

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=26>]

In the United States, examples such as the case of Kennewick Man
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man> have illustrated the
tensions between Native Americans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Native_Americans_in_the_United_States> and archaeologists, which can be
summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward
sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For
years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other
places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to
storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were
not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied.
Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from
those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many
natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-
gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire
consequences in the present.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent
archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while
American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific
knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This
contradictory situation was addressed by the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Native_American_Graves_Protection_and_Repatriation_Act> (NAGPRA, 1990),
which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research
institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of
postprocessualism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprocessualism>,
some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of
indigenous peoples <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples>
likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an
archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute
sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes,
mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance.
Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and
attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being
developed. Such work requires close links and trust between
archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same
time study.

While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to
fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders
cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of
sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the
elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active
efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological
profession.


Repatriation

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=27>]

    /See Repatriation and reburial of human remains <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_and_reburial_of_human_remains>/

A new trend in the heated controversy between First Nations <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada> groups and scientists is
the repatriation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation> of native
artifacts to the original descendants.^[/clarification needed <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify>/] An example of this
occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a
number of the 10 Algonquian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Algonquian_peoples> nations in the Ottawa <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Ottawa> area convened on the Kitigan Zibi <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitigan_Zibi> reservation near Maniwaki, Quebec
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniwaki,_Quebec>, to inter ancestral
human remains and burial goods—some dating back 6,000 years. It was not
determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the
Algonquin people <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_people> who
now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since
Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the
oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin
or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited
the area.^[/citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

The remains and artifacts, including jewelry <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Jewelry>, tools <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool> and weapons
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons>, were originally excavated from
various sites in the Ottawa Valley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ottawa_Valley>, including Morrison <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Morrison_Island> and the Allumette Islands <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Allumette_Island>. They had been part of the Canadian Museum of
Civilization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Canadian_Museum_of_Civilization>'s research collection for decades, some
since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities
conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional
red cedar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniperus_virginiana> and birch
bark <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_bark> boxes lined with red
cedar chips, muskrat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskrat> and beaver
pelts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver#Commercial_use>.^[/citation
needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

An inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80
boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further
scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense
between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach
agreement.^[145] <#cite_note-Canadian_Geographic_Online-146>


African diaspora archaeology

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=28>]
Main article: African diaspora archaeology <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/African_diaspora_archaeology>

African Diaspora Archaeology is an area of study within the subfield of
historical archaeology that studies those that have been forcibly
transported through the Atlantic Slave Trade <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade>, the Trans-Saharan Slave Trade <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Saharan_slave_trade>, and the Indian Ocean
Slave Trade <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_slave_trade>, as
well as their descendants. Although of global relevance, most research
has been conducted in the Americas and Africa.^[146] <#cite_note-147>
^[147] <#cite_note-148>

In the United States, Similar to the experience of Native Americans, the
history of African diaspora archaeology is one of controversies over
Whiteness <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteness_theory> in
archaeology and anthropology, a lack of inclusion of the African
descendant community,^[148] <#cite_note-149> and possession of human
remains in the collections of universities and museums.^[149]
<#cite_note-150> In the 1990s, anthropologist Michael Blakey <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Blakey_(anthropologist)> was the director
of research during the New York African Burial Ground Project <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Burial_Ground_National_Monument> where he
initiated a protocol for collaborating with the African descendant
community. In 2011, the Society of Black Archaeologists <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Black_Archaeologists> was created in
the United States <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States>.^[150]
<#cite_note-151> Co-founders Ayana Omilade Flewellen <https://
en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Ayana_Omilade_Flewellen&action=edit&redlink=1>, archaeologist at
the University of California, Riverside <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
University_of_California,_Riverside> and Justin Dunnavant, archaeologist
and assistant professor of anthropology at the University of California,
Los Angeles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
University_of_California,_Los_Angeles> intend to build a restorative
justice-based structure in archaeology. They suggest to define
descendants not only in genealogical terms, but also to welcome input of
African Americans whose ancestors had a shared historical experience in
enslavement.^[151] <#cite_note-152>

The United States Senate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
United_States_Senate> unanimously passed a bill^[152] <#cite_note-153>
in December 2020 that centers African American cemeteries at risk in
South Carolina. The bill is made to better protect historic African
burial grounds and can lead to the creation of an African American
Burial Grounds Network <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=African_American_Burial_Grounds_Network&action=edit&redlink=1>.^[153] <#cite_note-154> Barbados <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados>, eight days after becoming a republic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic> on November 30, 2021, announced plans for the construction of the /Newton Enslaved Burial Ground Memorial/ as well as a museum dedicated to the history of the Atlantic slave trade <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade>.^[154] <#cite_note-smithsonianmag.com-155> The Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Adjaye> is to lead the project that is to commemorate an estimated 570 West Africans buried in unmarked graves at the site of the former Newton sugar plantation.^[154] <#cite_note-smithsonianmag.com-155> ^[155] <#cite_note-156> Barbados can be seen as a good example of respectful preservation of an African burial ground. Throughout the Americas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas> however the burial grounds are in danger of being destroyed or human remains are being excavated without the descendant community being involved.^[156] <#cite_note-157> ^[157] <#cite_note-158> ^[158] <#cite_note-159> ^[159] <#cite_note-160> ^[160] <#cite_note-161> In 2022, residents on Sint Eustatius <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Eustatius>, Dutch Caribbean <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Caribbean> spoke out strongly against what they found were unethical excavations of their ancestors on the Godet African Burial Ground <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godet_African_Burial_Ground> and the Golden Rock African Burial Ground <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rock_African_Burial_Ground>.^[161] <#cite_note-162>


Climate change and archaeology

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=29>]

As anthropogenic climate change <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Climate_change> affects our environment, projections show that there
will be changes in rainfall with increased drought and desertification,
increases in intensity and frequency of rainfall, increases in
temperature (winter and summer), increases in both the temperature and
frequency of heatwaves, rising sea levels, and warmer seas, ocean
acidification and changes in oceanic currents. These climate drivers
will result in changes to flora and fauna, and changes in ground
conditions (both on and below the surface) and so will also affect
archaeological deposits and structures, while human responses to the
climate crisis will also impact archaeological sites. The
archaeologist's knowledge and skills are relevant to supporting society
in adapting to a changing climate and a low carbon future.^[162]
<#cite_note-163> ^[163] <#cite_note-164> Another effect of higher
temperatures has been melting of glaciers and ice patches. This has led
to the discovery of artifacts and bodies long buried in the ice,
fostering the new field of glacial archaeology <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_archaeology>.^[164] <#cite_note-165>
^[165] <#cite_note-166>

Archaeological sites can be seen as habitats that support ecosystems and
fulfil biodiversity goals.^[166] <#cite_note-167>


AI in archaeology

[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Archaeology&action=edit&section=30>]

As artificial intelligence (AI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Artificial_intelligence_(AI)> continues to influence scientific
research, its application in archaeological studies has become
increasingly significant. For instance, AI models have been utilized to
identify archaeological remains in the Empty Quarter <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Quarter> of the Arabian Peninsula
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula>.^[167]
<#cite_note-168> ^[168] <#cite_note-169> Additionally, AI technology has
facilitated the discovery of 303 new geoglyphs in Nazca.^[169]
